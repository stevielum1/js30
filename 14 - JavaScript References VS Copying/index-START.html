    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // primitive types make copies
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age2 = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, players2)
    players2[3] = 'Bob';
    console.log(players, players2)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const arrayCopy1 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const arrayCopy2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const arrayCopy3 = [...players];

    const arrayCopy4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const objectCopy1 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const objectCopy2 = {...person}; // this does work

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wes",
        facebook: "wesbos.developer"
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.social.twitter = "@notwes"; //modifies original object

    const devCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
